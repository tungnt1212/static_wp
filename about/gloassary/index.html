                                The sum count of unique wallets that were active in the network (either as a destination or source of a ledger change) that day. All unique wallets involved in a ledger change action (recipients and originators) are counted. This metric does not double-count wallets. In other words, if a wallet has been deemed active by being part of a ledger change, it is not counted again if it is subsequently involved in a transaction during the same time interval. Wallets represent groups of addresses that we estimate are owned by the same entity. They provide a better proxy for user behavior since users often own more than one blockchain address.

                                An automated market maker (AMM) is a tool used to provide liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi). They are used to enable the automatic trading of digital assets. They do this by using liquidity pools as a replacement for traditional buyer and seller markets. Automated Market Makers determine price adjustments of tokens and incentivize users to provide liquidity to trading pairs in decentralized exchanges and earn returns. AMMs ensure that there is liquidity for users to buy a specific token, without relying on another party to execute the trade. They eliminate the need to rely on external market makers to provide liquidity for trading pairs.

                                Automated trading – also known as algorithmic trading – uses algorithms to make trade orders. To set up automated trading, you will need an automated trading system. You can then set up the rules you want the automated trading system to follow based on common variables like price and volume or technical indicators like moving averages or Bollinger bands. The trading strategy you set up can be as simple or as complicated as you want, but truly advanced strategies require learning the programming language associated with your automated trading system.

                                The Average Balance (in $) indicator calculates the mean value an address holds for a particular crypto-asset. It measure by dividing the market cap over the total number of addresses holding this crypto-asset. In other words, it excludes addresses with a balance of zero to arrive at the average holdings on-chain.

                                The Average Transaction Size indicator measures the mean transaction value for a crypto-asset on any given day. This metric is calculated in dollar terms by taking timestamps of every on-chain transaction and multiplied by the asset’s price at that time, then summing the total dollar value and dividing it by the total number of transactions. Additionally, it can also be shown in crypto-terms.

                                A unit of measurement used to quantify the change between two percentages – it can also be referred to as ‘bp’, which is pronounced ‘bip’ or ‘beep’. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent or 0.01%. This means that a 0.01% change is a one-bp move, a 1% change is a 100-bp move, and a 10% change is a 1000-bp move. Basis points are commonly used to define interest rates, quote price changes in the stock market, and outline the cost of exchange-traded fund mutual funds. They help traders and analysts clarify the change between two percentages – instead of saying a 10% increase on a 10% rate; it can be described as a 1000 bps change. By creating a universal measure, any confusion over movements in prices and interest rates is eliminated.

                                Being bearish in trading means you believe that a market, asset or financial instrument will experience a downward trajectory. Being bearish is the opposite of bullish, which means you think the market is heading upwards. Identifying bearish trends is essential to trading because market sentiment is a key factor in determining how financial markets move. When the bearish pressure in a market is stronger than the bullish pressure, the market will usually drop in price. For this reason, a market experiencing a sustained price decline will be referred to as a bear market. Spotting when a bear market is taking hold or coming to an end is key to profiting and limiting loss when trading. Bearish traders believe that a market will soon drop in value and attempt to profit from its decline. This puts them in contention with bulls, who will buy a market believing that doing so will return a profit.

                                The price at which a trader can sell an underlying asset to a broker or market maker. From the market maker's perspective, the bid price is the price at which they are willing to buy the underlying asset from the trader. The bid price is one of the two prices quoted when trading financial support, the other being the offer price. The difference between the bid price and the offer price is known as the spread, which is the cost that a trader will incur to open a position. The bid price will always be slightly lower than the market price, while the offer price will always be slightly above it.

The seller, also known as the writer, has an obligation to sell the underlying asset – at the agreed-upon price, called the strike price – if the option is executed by the buyer, also known as the holder. The seller is paid a premium for accepting the risks associated with the obligation to sell.

                                We often group examples as a first step to understanding a subject (data set) in a machine learning system. Grouping unlabeled examples are called clustering. As the samples are unlabeled, clustering relies on unsupervised machine learning. However, if the samples are labeled, then clustering becomes classification—an on-chain environment.

Concentration ratios tend to feature in economic research and reports and are displayed as an equation. The number of companies considered in the concentration ratio is shown in superscript next to the letters CR. The most common ratios are CR4 and CR8, indicating the comparative output of the four and eight biggest firms in a sector compared to the rest. CR1, on the other hand, is the relative size of the single most prominent firm in an industry.

                                A unit of measurement used to quantify the change between two percentages – it can also be referred to as ‘bp’, which is pronounced ‘bip’ or ‘beep’. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent or 0.01%. This means that a 0.01% change is a one-bp move, a 1% change is a 100-bp move, and a 10% change is a 1000-bp move. Basis points are commonly used to define interest rates, quote price changes in the stock market, and outline the cost of exchange-traded fund mutual funds. They help traders and analysts clarify the change between two percentages – instead of saying a 10% increase on a 10% rate; it can be described as a 1000 bps change. By creating a universal measure, any confusion over movements in prices and interest rates is eliminated.

Dark pools can also be referred to as dark pool liquidity or dark liquidity. They came about as a way for large-scale investors to make deals with each other that would not result in an adverse price move against them. If an investor wants to sell a major portion of a company’s stock on a public exchange, they must declare their intention and run the risk that the value of the stock will drop, thanks to the swell in supply. Dark pools remove this risk by announcing deals only after they have taken place and restricting access to

                                Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow is the ratio of the current market capitalization and the annualized dormancy value (measured in USD). Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow can be used to time market lows and assess whether the bull market remains in relatively normal conditions. It helps confirm whether Bitcoin is in a bullish or bearish primary trend. This metric was put forward by David Puell. For more information please read his introductory article.

                                The estimated entity-adjusted number of transactions is defined as the number of transactions between different entities, i.e. the total number of transactions excluding transactions within addresses of the same entity. Entities are defined as a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode's proprietary clustering algorithms. Note that entity–based metrics are based on data science techniques and statistical information that changes over time and are therefore mutable – the data is stable, but most recent data points are subject to slight fluctuations as time progresses.

A Flash Loan is a type of loan where the asset, often Ethereum or an ERC-20 coin, is loaned out only for the duration of the length of time it takes to complete one transaction block on the blockchain. As long as the loan is paid back before the next transaction block begins there is no interest fee incurred by the borrower.

                                A derivative of delta: the relationship between a derivative’s price and the price of its underlying asset. Specifically, gamma is the movement of delta in regard to the price of the underlying asset. If an option has a large gamma, then its price movement in relation to the price movement of its underlying asset is volatile. That enhances both risk and reward because any price move in the underlying asset will be amplified in the price movement of its option. Gamma is always at its largest when a trade is at the money and smallest when it is deeply in or out of the money.

                                In AMMs, lending providers (LPs) contribute assets to provide liquidity for market participants. LPs occasionally will not receive the exact amount of assets upon withdrawal. The dollar value of the assets they withdraw would typically be lower than if they had no provided liquidity and just held the assets. This dollar value shortfall is known as impermanent loss. The loss is said to be ‘impermanent’ because if asset prices return to the level during withdrawal the loss is eliminated.

This allows the ecosystem to benefit from individual progress, pushing decentralized finance continually forward. As participants build useful things, they are able to be shared and combined in new ways, reminiscent of everyone’s favorite toy, Lego. When new people dive into the Lego ‘bin’, they find individual legos or preassembled combinations of Legos that they too start building with, creating bigger and better things.

                                In CeFi leverage means borrowing or using multipliers such as margin functions to amplify gains on trading. In DeFi it more specifically refers to the use of multipliers on exchanges eg: providing 1 Bitcoin (BTC) deposit on such an exchange could provide the investment power of 10 to 100 BTC if used at 10x to 100x leverage. Leveraged trades can amplify gains greatly but can also amplify losses as much or more on loss-making trades.

                                The maximum amounts a commodity future may increase (limit up) or decrease (limit down) on any trading day. They protect futures contracts from unexpected events that may cause major moves in their underlying commodity’s price. Without a limit up or limit down, there is a risk that a futures contract’s price will reach an irrational value because of market panic. Limit ups and limit downs can cause a discrepancy between a market’s price and the price reflected in its corresponding futures contract. If a market makes a major move in a very short time, the contract price may reach its limit up or down for several days before it matches the market’s price once more.

When there is a high demand for an asset, there is high liquidity, as it will be easier to find a buyer (or seller) for that asset.

                                A margin deposit is he initial amount of money a trader needs to put down to open a leveraged trading position. It can also be known as the initial margin, deposit margin, or the deposit. The margin deposit is usually stated as a percentage of the full value of the trade – leveraged provider’s margin system determines it. The amount needed as a deposit margin depends on the derivative being used and the market being traded. Markets with higher volatility or larger positions may require a higher deposit margin. A margin deposit is one of two main types of margin needed to hold an open leveraged position. The other is called maintenance margin. This term describes the additional funds that might be needed to cover any running losses or keep a position open.

                                Dark pools are networks – usually private exchanges or forums – that allow institutional investors to buy or sell large amounts of stock without the details of the trade being released to the wider market. Dark pools can also be referred to as dark pool liquidity or dark liquidity. They came about as a way for large-scale investors to make deals with each other that would not result in an adverse price move against them. If an investor wants to sell a major portion of a company’s stock on a public exchange, they must declare their intention and run the risk that the value of the stock will drop, thanks to the swell in supply. Dark pools remove this risk by announcing deals only after they have taken place and restricting access to

                                The MVRV Z-Score is used to assess when Bitcoin is over/undervalued relative to its "fair value". When market value is significantly higher than realized value, it has historically indicated a market top (red zone), while the opposite has indicated market bottoms (green zone). Technically, MVRV Z-Score is defined as the ratio between the difference of market cap and realized cap, and the standard deviation of market cap, i.e. (market cap – realized cap) / std.

                                A blockchain validator is a network node that helps process and validate transaction blocks on the platform so that they can be added to the permanent ledger of the blockchain. When using the term “validator,” some people presume the nodes validating transactions on PoS blockchains.

                                Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled for an asset, such as options or futures. The total open interest does not count, and the total every buys and sell the contract. Instead, open interest provides a more accurate picture of the options trading activity and whether money flows into the futures and options market are increasing or decreasing. If a buyer and seller come together and initiate a new position of one contract, then open interest will increase by one contract. Open interest decreases by one contract if a buyer and seller exit a one cone-contraction on a trade. However, if a buyer or seller passes off their current position to a new buyer or seller, then open interest remains unchanged.

                                Implied Volatility is the market's expectation of volatility. Given the price of an option, we can solve for the expected volatility of the underlying asset. Formally, implied volatility (IV) is the one standard deviation range of the expected movement of an asset’s price over the course of a year. Viewing At-The-Money (ATM) IV over time gives a normalized view of volatility expectations which will often rise and fall with realized volatility and market sentiment. This metric shows the ATM implied volatility for options contracts expiring 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months from today.

                                Matching is the procedure of finding pairs or groups of orders that are executed against each other. In its simplest form, there is one buy order and one sell order that are both executed at the same execution price and with the same quantity. However, in general, several orders on the buy side can be executed against several orders on the sell side. The execution price is the same for all involved orders, and the accumulated executed quantity on the buy side must equal the accumulated executed quantity on the sell side.

                                Proof of Developer, or PoD, is a verification system designed to prove to investors who the real developer behind a certain cryptocurrency or crypto project is. It’s intended to prevent investors from falling victim to fraudulent transactions.

                                Proof of stake, or PoS, is a consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. With a PoS consensus, miners are replaced by validators, who stake their cryptocurrency to bet on the next block. If the block they bet on is validated, they earn rewards.

                                Slippage occurs when a trader uses market orders. Market orders are one of the order types that are used to enter or exit positions. To help eliminate or reduce slippage, traders use limit orders instead of market orders. A limit order only fills at the price you want, or better.

                                The Realized HODL Ratio is a market indicator that uses a ratio of the Realized Cap HODL Waves. In particular, the RHODL Ratio takes the ratio between the 1 week and the 1-2 years RCap HODL bands. In addition, it accounts for increased supply by weighting the ratio by the total market age. A high ratio is an indication of an overheated market and can be used to time cycle tops. This metric was created by Philip Swift.

                                A sandwich attack is a form of front-running that primarily targets decentralized finance protocols and services. In a sandwich attack, a nefarious trader looks for a pending transaction on the network of their choice, e.g., Ethereum. The sandwiching occurs by placing one order right before the trade and one right after it. In essence, the attacker will front-run and back-run simultaneously, with the original pending transaction sandwiched in between.

                                A scalp in trading is the act of opening and then closing a position very quickly in the hope of profiting from small price movements. Traders who practise this tactic are called scalpers and tend to make many scalps daily. The theory behind scalping is that small price movements are easier to predict than large ones. Profits on scalps tend to be small, but losses can be kept to a minimum as strict rules are adhered to.

                                The Stock to Flow (S/F) Ratio is a popular model that assumes that scarcity drives value. Stock to Flow is defined as the ratio of the current stock of a commodity (i.e. circulating Bitcoin supply) and the flow of new production (i.e. newly mined bitcoins). Bitcoin's price has historically followed the S/F Ratio and therefore it is a model that can be used to predict future Bitcoin valuations. This metric was first coined by PlanB. For a detailed description, see this article.

                                A Stop-limit Order triggers a limit order. When setting a Stop-limit, the trader puts a stop price at which the order can be triggered, and a limit price for the order may be filled. Thus, once the stop of a Stop-limit order is triggered, the limit order would automatically create. Stop-Limit orders can help prevent slippage on Stop orders.

                                A trailing step is a measure of price movement and a key component of a trailing stop order – a type of stop-loss order that follows your position if it earns you profit and closes if the market moves against you.The value of a trailing step is set in pips. So, a trailing step of 50 pips would only move after 50 points of movement in the price of the asset.The trailing step is one of the parameters you set to manage the how your trailing stop-loss follows the market price. It dictates how much the underlying market needs to move before your trailing stop re-adjusts. The larger your trailing step, the more the market has to move before your stop is re-positioned, and the less frequently the ‘trailing’ would be performed.

                                A Trailing Stop Order provides flexibility over a stop order by executing only once the market goes against you by a defined price distance. Thus, you can use a trailing stop order to protect profit. A trailing stop is a modification of a typical stop order that can be set at a defined percentage or dollar amount away from a security's current market price. For a long position, an investor places a trailing stop loss below the current market price.

                                The turnover ratio is an advanced derivatives indicator which shows the 24 hour volume of a derivatives contract over its open interest. This provides the ratio of short-term trading and speculation relative to longer-term positions. During volatile periods, turnover tends to increase as traders look to profit on short-term price variations.

Newer early-stage technology companies and projects in the explosive growth stage tend to see very high volatility in the price of their assets in their early days. Should the company or project behind the volatile asset see their venture survive over time, this volatility tends to be much reduced as the company's market cap grows and matures.

                                Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day. For instance, stock trading volume would refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close. Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders.

                                The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a measurement that shows the average price of a security, adjusted for its volume. It is calculated during a specific trading session by taking the total dollar value of trading in the security and dividing it by the volume of trades.

                                wETH is wrapped Ether. The reason you need wETH is to be able to trade ETH for other ERC-20 tokens on decentralized platforms as ETH was the proto-token of the Ethereum Alt tokens, which means it was built before the ERC-20 standard existed. Because decentralized platforms running on Ethereum use smart contracts to facilitate trades directly between users, every user needs to have the same standardized format for every token they trade. This ensures tokens don’t get lost in translation.
